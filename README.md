# CSS `calc()` Spacing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in CSS related to the `calc()` function. Incorrect spacing around arithmetic operators within the `calc()` function can lead to unexpected results or parsing errors. 

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.css` provides the correct implementation.  Proper spacing ensures the CSS parser correctly interprets and evaluates the calculation.
