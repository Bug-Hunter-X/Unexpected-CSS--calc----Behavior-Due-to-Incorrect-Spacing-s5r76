The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, unexpected behavior may occur if spaces are not used correctly. For example, in the following code, omitting spaces around the `+` operator will result in an error:

```css
.element{width:calc(100% +50px);}
```

The correct syntax requires spaces around operators:

```css
.element{width:calc(100% + 50px);}
```
